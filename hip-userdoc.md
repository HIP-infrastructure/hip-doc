 * [URL: https://thehip.app](https://thehip.app)

Uploading data
==============
 * [Install Nextcloud client and shared drive](hip-upload-nexcloud-drive.md)
 * [Uploading data using the web](hip-upload-nexcloud-web.md)

HIP apps
========
 * [Anywave on the HIP](hip-anywave.md) and its [official website](https://meg.univ-amu.fr/wiki/AnyWave): view and edit EEG, iEEG and MEG signals

 * [BIDSManager on the HIP](hip-bidsmanager.md) and its [official repository](https://github.com/Dynamap/BIDS_Manager): create and manage a well-organized [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) database.

 * [Brainstorm on the HIP](hip-brainstorm.md) and its full [official documentation](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/):  an application dedicated to the analysis       of brain recordings: MEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, depth electrodes and multiunit electrophysiology.

 * [CCEP Manager on the HIP](hip-ccep.md) and its [official documentation](https://ccepmanager.readthedocs.io): an application from [F-Tract](https://f-tract.eu/) project to process iEEG data coupled with electrical stimulation for the extraction of Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials (CCEP) features. It generates connectivity atlases from processed data.

 * Dcm2niix and its [Official repository](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix): convert DICOM to Nifti files (MRI, CT scanner...). 

 * FSL and its [official website](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/): a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data.

 * [Freesurfer on the HIP](hip-freesurfer.md) and its [official documentation](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu): a software package for the analysis and visualization of structural and  functional neuroimaging data from cross-sectional or longitudinal  studies.

 * HiBop and its [official repository](https://github.com/hbp-HiBoP/HiBoP): an application dedicated to the visualization of intracranial brain recordings.

 * [IntrAnat on the HIP](hip-intranat.md) and its [official documentation]( https://intranat.readthedocs.io): an application to locate and visualize electrode implantations on images (MRI, CT-scan, PET, brain atlases...), export their coordinates and prepare databases for group studies.

 * Localizer

 * MRIcroGL and its [official website](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/mricrogl:MainPage): a medical image viewer

 * 3D Slicer and its [official website](https://www.slicer.org/):  an image computing platform widely used for medical, biomedical, and related imaging research.

 * TVB (The Virtual Brain)
   - [HIP TVB app](https://github.com/ins-amu/hip-tvb-app)
   - [TVB Pipeline](https://github.com/ins-amu/tvb-pipeline)
   - [Bayesian Virtual Epileptic Patient](https://github.com/ins-amu/BVEP)
